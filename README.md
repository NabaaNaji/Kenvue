# Kenvue Project README

#### How are you going to approach the problem(abstract)? 

First we will clean the data to make it more readable and comprehensive for further analysis. We will turn the wide data into a long data format for improved critiquing in python.

After cleaning the data we will perform the following analyses: 

Demand Forecasting Accuracy:

Use the Factory POS and Total Ecomm POS datasets to analyze historical sales trends, identifying patterns and variances in demand across different products and regions.

Inventory Optimization:

Analyze the Customer DC Inventory data to understand current inventory levels, turnover rates, and identify potential overstock or stockout situations.
Explore correlations between inventory levels, sales trends, and seasonal fluctuations to identify areas for improvement.

Product Availability and Customer Satisfaction:

Leverage insights from sales and inventory data to identify how stock levels affect product availability and, consequently, customer satisfaction and sales.
Conduct qualitative analysis, possibly through customer feedback or market research, to understand the impact of product availability on customer purchase decisions.

We will consider the following need states:
1. Allergy care
2. Hair care
3. Sun care

#### What do you hope to achieve, given the data?

#### Who is in your group, and what is the division of labour?

#### How are you going to 'clean' and organize the data?

#### What external data/website are you using to aid your analysis(references)? 

#### What technologies are involved (software, packages/libraries, techniques)?
