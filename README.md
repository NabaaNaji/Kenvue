# **Business Case With Kenvue**

</div>

### How are you going to approach the problem(abstract)? 

First we will clean the data to make it more readable and comprehensive for further analysis. We will turn the wide data into a long data format for improved critiquing in python. After cleaning the data we will perform the following analyses: 

1. **Demand Forecasting:**

  - Use the Factory POS and Total Ecomm POS datasets to analyze historical sales trends, identifying patterns and variances in demand across different products and regions.

2. **Inventory Optimization:**

  - Analyze the Customer DC Inventory data to understand current inventory levels, turnover rates, and identify potential overstock or stockout situations.
  - Explore correlations between inventory levels, sales trends, and seasonal fluctuations to identify areas for improvement.

3. **Product Availability and Customer Satisfaction:**

  - Leverage insights from sales and inventory data to identify how stock levels affect product availability and, consequently, customer satisfaction and sales.
  - Conduct qualitative analysis, possibly through customer feedback or market research, to understand the impact of product availability on customer purchase decisions.

**Need States Focus:**

1. Allergy care - Mostly cyclical based on seasonality 
2. Hair care - Dependable on consumer needs
3. Sun care - Typically based on seasonality, but can vary among consumer preference

### What do you hope to achieve, given the data?

Our objectives are:

1. Evaluate sales trends and historical data to find varying patterns throughout the distributions of retail products.
2. Optimize inventory levels to minimize stock outs and overstock situations.
3. Enhance product availability to improve customer experience/satisfaction and overall sales performance for all the need states.
4. Identify and assess need states and their impact on consumer purchasing behaviour, to maximize business growth opportunities.
5. Leverage web scraping to enhance our analysis, helping us to draw well-informed conclusions backed by data-driven insights.

### Who is in your group, and what is the division of labour?

1. **Nabaa**: Data Cleaning and Organization
2. **Sebastian**: Data Analysis and Modeling
3. **Roshan**: Market Research and Customer Feedback Analysis
4. **Sara**: Visualization and Data Presentation

---

### How are you going to 'clean' and organize the data?

1. Using Python (Jupyter Notebook) we will convert wide data into long data to facilitate the analysis. 
2. We will use various libraries that have modules which will aid in cleaning and understanding the data.
3. Remove duplicate data, standardize data formats and handle zeroed values to ensure the validity of the data.
4. Ensure concise documentation (comments) and modular code within the Jupyter Notebook to enhance readability and facilitate the reproducibility of the data cleaning process.

---

### What external data/website are you using to aid your analysis(references)? 

1. We will web scrape to gather up-to-date information on consumer preferences and industry developments. This will help us identify emerging trends that could influence business strategies.
2. Access industry reports and market research databases to derive insights into consumer behaviour, market dynamics, and competitor strategies. These resources will give potential areas for innovation and growth.
3. Use demographic data from government databases and research institutions, to tailor our business strategies to meet the unique needs of different customer segments, enhancing customer engagement and value proposition.
4. We'll integrate external datasets focusing on healthcare trends and consumer behaviour to deepen our understanding of customer needs and preferences. This will inform product development and marketing strategies, ensuring they are aligned with consumer demand.

### What technologies are involved (software, packages/libraries, techniques)?

1. **Software**: Excel, Jupyter Notebook
2. **Packages**/Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, NumPy
3. **Techniques**: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, linear regression modeling, data visualizations
